You must get wrong,because we didn't provide database we use(mongodb),so you must have own database(This database is for stopword and reserved word for jieba),or modify it by yourself

We remove the fonts that provide users choice, please download what you need online(example:NotoSansCJKtc-Medium.otf).

"Save" this file is for jieba,you can customize it




This system focus on caculate word frequency and generate word cloud.We provide many choices for users,they can choose font and color in word cloud and also can upload a picture they want to change the shape of the word cloud.
